This is a module that should be injected into the guest to 
allow selective system call exiting. FSCEU stands for Fast System-Call Exiting 
Utility. Once enabled, only the system call vectors enabled in an in-memory byte array
will cause VM exits.

Note that the Makefile needs to be modified to point to the kernel source 
tree of the *GUEST* kernel.
