This directory contains the sources for a VNC server designed for use
with the Graphics Console interface.   It is a variant of the x0vncserver
that ships with the VNC sources.  It's used with the following flow:

  any vncclient
      |
 this x0vncserver
      |
graphics console userspace interface
      |
virtual device (vga.c, paragraph.c, ...)
      |
    guest

Building VNC tools generally needs to be done in the context
of the VNC distribution.    You cannot compile here.  You
want to build this in the following way:

0. build palacios/linux_usr to give you libv3_fb.a
1. get a copy of the VNC distro - this is based on 4.0
2. configure and build the whole thing
3. you'll notice that the VNC distro has a x0vncserver
   directory/target.   This directory needs to either
   replace it, patch it, or go alongside it.
   Notice that VNC generates Makefiles as part of configuration.
4. modify the Makefile to reflect the one seen here. 
   namely, you will want the following:

V3FB_DIR = path/to/palacios/linux_usr

EXTRA_LIBS += -L$(V3FB_DIR) -lv3_fb

DIR_CPPFLAGS +=  -I$(V3FB_DIR)

5. build x0vncserver
6. cp x0vncserver palacios/linux_usr
7. cd palacios/linux_usr; make v3_x0vncserver
