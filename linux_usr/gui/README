This directory contains an implementation of a graphical user
interface for Palacios VMs, analogous to the "server console" tool in
VMware or VirtualBox, etc.  The GUI builds directly on top of the
Palacios command-line utilities.  

The GUI was initially implemented by Abhinav Kannan and is:

(c) 2012 Abhinav Kannan
(c) 2012 V3VEE Project

As with other Linux interface components of Palacios, it is released
under GPL.  Palacios itself is released under a BSD license. 


PREREQUISITES
=============

To build the GUI, you will need to install various libraries and
components.  Specifically, you need:

- QT4
- QT4 development support and tools (qmake)
- LibVNCServer
- GNUTLS and GNUTLS development support


The easiest way to do this is to become root and then use
your package manager.  

For example, on a Red Hat or Fedora system:

su - (become root)
yum install qt4
yum install qt4-devel
yum install libvncsever
yum install libvncserver-devel
yum install gnutls
yum install gnutls-devel
exit (return to normal user)

If you need to set up as a none-root user, please see the file
report.pdf.  
   

BUILDING
========

1. Use qmake to build a Makefile for your machine:

qmake Palacos.Pro

2. make it

make 

3. you should now have an executable file "Palacios"
   this will become palacios/linux_usr/v3_x0gui
   and will be wrapped by the script palacios/linux_usr/v3_gui

If you would like to change things, please read report.pdf.
The "Palacios.pro" file mentioned in the report is 
included here as "Palacios.pro.locallibs"

RUNNING
=======

To run the GUI, the Palacios command-line utilities and xterm need to
be on your path, and v3vee.ko kernel module must be inserted into
the running kernel.    For example:

export PATH=$PATH:/home/foo/palacios/linxu_usr:/path/to/xterm
insmod /home/foo/palacios/v3vee.ko
