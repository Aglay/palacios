Palacios Internal Developer Manual
}
\author{Jack Lange}

\maketitle


This manual is written for Internal Palacios developers. It contains
information on how to obtain the palacios code base, how to go about
the development process, and how to commit those changes to the
mainline source tree. For in depth information on the palacios code
structure please see {\em An Introduction to the Palacios Virtual
Machine Monitor -- Release 1.0}.


\section{Overview}


Both Palacios and Kitten follow a hybrid development process that
uses both the centralized repository and distributed development
models. A central repository exists that holds the master version of
the code base. This central repository is cloned by multiple people
and in multiple places to support various development efforts. A
feature of git is that every developer actually has a fully copy of
the entire repository, and so can function independently until such
time as they need to resync with the master version. 

There are typically multiple levels of access to the central
repository, that are granted based on the type of developer being
granted access. The three basic developer types and their access
privileges are:

\begin{itemize}
\item Core Developers: These are the lead developers and are in
charge of managing the master repository. They have full read/write
access permissions to the central repository.

\item Internal Developers: Formal members of the development
team. These people are capable of pulling directly from the central
repository, but lack the ability to write directly to it. 

\item External Developers: People who are not actual members of the
development team. These people can only access the public repository
which is only updated to contain the release versions. 
\end{itemize}

Because internal and external developers cannot write directly to the
master repository, they need to first submit their changes to a core
developer before they can be added to the mainline. We will discuss
that process in Section~\ref{sec:submission}.

\section{Checking out Palacios}

Checkout or clone the devel branch of Palacios from the master
repository. You should have the read permission to these branches.


\section{Checking out Kitten}

hg clone /home/palacios/kitten

git clone /home/palacios/palacios

/opt/vmm-tools/bin/checkout\_branch devel


\section{Compiling Palacios}
cd palacios/build/


This will build Palacios as a library, libv3vee.a in the palacios/palacios/build/.


\section{Compiling Kitten}
\subsection{Configuration}
Kitten building can be configured by either text or graph configure interface, which is similar to the Linux kernel configure, By one of the following commands:

make xconfig
make config
make menuconfig

Make sure turn on the network device driver, networking, and input kernel command 'console=serial net=rtl8139'
\subsection{Compilation}

Build Palacios as a module for Kitten
In the first time, make sure to build Kitten before you building the Palacios as the module to kitten. 
Palacios now is built as a module of the Kitten. You can find the palacios.c and palacios.h in the kitten/palacios/. Enter the directory, build the palacios module.

cd kitten/palacios
make -C .. M=`pwd`
cp built-in.o ../modules/palacios-mod.o
Build Kitten
Go back to kitten root directory, and build the Kitten again.

make  isoimage

\section{Running Palacios/Kitten}
Run the whole stuff built above in Qemu using following command: 

/usr/local/qemu/bin/qemu-system-x86\_64 -smp 1 -m 1024 -serial file:./serial.out -cdrom ./arch/x86\_64/boot/image.iso  -net tap, ifname=tap0  < /dev/null


\section{Networking}

\section{Configuring the development host's Qemu network}
Set up Tap interfaces:

/root/util/tap\_create tapX

Bridging tapX with eth1 will only work (work = send packet and also make packet visible on localhost) if the IP address is set correctly (correctly = match network it is connected to  e.g., network of eth1)  so bring up the network inside of the VM / QEMU as 10-net, and it should route through the eth1 rule and be visible both on the host and in the physical network


\subsection{Configuring Kitten}

How to set ip address in kitten:

Kitten ip address setting is in file drivers/net/ne2k/rtl8139.c, in the code below which is located in function rtl8139\_init.

  struct ip\_addr ipaddr = { htonl(0 | 10 << 24 | 0 << 16 | 2 << 8 | 16 << 0) }; 
  struct ip\_addr netmask = { htonl(0xffffff00) }; 
  struct ip\_addr gw = { htonl(0 | 10 << 24 | 0 << 16 | 2 << 8 | 2 << 0) };

This sets the ip address as 10.0.2.16, netmask 255.255.255.0 and gateway address 10.0.2.2, change it as you need.



\subsection{Running with networking}

\paragraph*{Tap Interface}
In which, the command line: 

-net tap, ifname=tap2

specifies Qemu to use the host's tap0 as its network interface, then Qemu can access the host's physical network.

\paragraph*{Redirection}

Also you can use the following command instead to redirect host's 9555 port to Qemu's 80 port.

-net user -net nic,model=rtl8139  -redir tcp:9555::80

In this case, you can access Qemu's 80 port in the host like:

telnet localhost 9555

Qemu has many options to build up a virtual or real networking. See http://www.h7.dion.ne.jp/~qemu-win/HowToNetwork-en.html for more information.
